# Blocked Bank Account

A blocked bank account restricts access to funds until specific conditions are met, providing businesses and individuals with a secure way to ensure compliance with legal or regulatory requirements, thereby addressing the need for financial control and protection against unauthorized access. We manage G-accounts, escrow accounts, and other scenarios where bespoke bank accounts are necessary for handling payments.
